## Virtual DOM and createRoot

**createRoot** initializes a React application and manages its own Virtual DOM. It compares this Virtual DOM with the actual DOM in the browser and only updates the parts that have changed.

## Browser DOM Reloading

Traditional web applications often reload the entire DOM to reflect updates, which is inefficient because the entire page is re-rendered even if only a small part of it has changed.

## Efficient Updates with Virtual DOM

The Virtual DOM maintains a tree-like structure of the UI. It tracks changes and updates only those parts of the actual DOM that have been modified, ensuring more efficient rendering.

## Network-dependent Updates

Some UI updates depend on asynchronous network calls. When a value is updated through a network response, it may need to be updated again. To avoid redundant updates, optimizations can be made to drop unnecessary immediate updates.

## React Fiber Algorithm

The current rendering algorithm used by React is called the React Fiber algorithm. It improves the efficiency and performance of rendering updates.

## Reconciliation

Reconciliation is the process React uses to compare the Virtual DOM with the actual DOM and determine what changes need to be made. This is the core mechanism behind the Virtual DOM's efficiency.

## Virtual DOM Concept

The concept of the Virtual DOM is central to React's performance. It allows React to minimize direct manipulations of the actual DOM, leading to faster and more efficient updates.

## UI Update Strategy

In a UI, not every update needs to be applied immediately. Delaying or batching updates can lead to better performance and a smoother user experience.
